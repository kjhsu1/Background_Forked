# Kenta_Stuff Overview

This directory contains Kenta's scripts and data for generating synthetic CHIP-seq reads and running peak calling pipelines.  The files are organised into a few main folders:

- **Bowtie2_Stuff** – Bowtie2 index files used for alignment.
- **Generated_Data** – output from the pipeline including FASTA reads, alignments and peak calls.
- **Genomes** – input genome FASTA files.
- **Scripts** – Python scripts for genome generation, read simulation and calling peaks.  The
  `peak_caller_pipeline` subfolder holds the end‑to‑end pipeline.
- **environment.yml** – conda environment with bowtie2, samtools and macs2.
- **instructions.md** and **AGENTS.md** – coding standards for this project.

## Scripts

The `Scripts` folder contains several utilities:

- `chip_seq.py` – generates synthetic CHIP‑seq reads with configurable coverage
  and peak parameters.
- `random_genome_generator.py` – creates small random genomes for testing.
- `run_chip_seq_all_coverages.py` – runs `chip_seq.py` for a list of coverages.
- `peak_caller_pipeline/` – pipeline that aligns reads with bowtie2, converts SAM
  to sorted and indexed BAM and calls peaks with MACS2.  Key components are:
  - `pipeline.py` – orchestrates the whole process.
  - `sam_to_bams.py` – converts a SAM file to BAM, sorted BAM and index.
  - `bam_to_peaks_called.py` – calls peaks using MACS2 on a pair of BAM files.
  - `run_pipeline_all_combs.py` – runs the pipeline on all combinations of
    experiment and control FASTAs.

Utility modules such as `LIB.py` and `genome_size.py` provide helper functions.
Most scripts use `argparse` for command line arguments and follow the coding
conventions documented in `instructions.md`.

## Data Layout

`Generated_Data` is divided into subdirectories:

- `Reads_FASTA` – simulated read FASTA files for both experiment and control
  samples.
- `Alignments` – SAM and BAM outputs generated by the pipeline.
- `peaks_called` – MACS2 narrowPeak, summits and xls files for each coverage
  combination.

This structure keeps inputs and results separate from the scripts so that the
pipeline can be rerun with different parameters.
